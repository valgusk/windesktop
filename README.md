# windesktop
use applications as cinnamon background

I know nothing about cinnamon coding, linux de structure, c coding or bash coding, so feel free to suggest better ways to do things

- uses some code as example from lrewega/xwinwrap
- requires xprop, wmctrl, mvp, socat, xwininfo to run without modifying the script
- add windesktop.sh as a startup application to have it enabled on startup
- if something goes wrong, run 'killall windesktop.sh'
